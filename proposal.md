## Thesis Proposal 
### 1. Motivation
why interesting field?
why interesting topic/question?
### 2. Hypothesis
maybe: "Learning to return to unvisited states increases teh generalization in mutlti task learning."
### 3. Experiments


look at max paper, use his experiment as baseline, with different versions: 
 - one with epsilon (multiple durations of exploring)
 - one with go explore tp to half goal (position of a random state from replay buffer),
 - one with uvf go to half goal  
### 4. Formalization
look at drl lectures, think about loss functions, how to structure shit, 
### 5. Literature Review 
 - HER
 - GO EXPLORE
 - MAX PAPER
 - look if other papers try to increase generalization by utilizing HER or go explore
