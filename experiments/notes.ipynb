    "## Questions to ask: \n",
    " - can the idea of 2 networks be called a weird version of actor critic? (for reading/implementation purposes) \n",
    " - should uvf and main have the same buffer? (is it even feasible), 2 buffer would be easier, merging to one makes more sense when merging networks to one,\n",
    "   uvf should use both, main agent only itself, q functions on everything\n",
    " - should I even keep the chance thingy or for starters just do 100% chance runs? 0,50,100\n",
    " - should I rather extract target as coordinates, or just the corresponding layer (as one layer of input is just position)? also should I alter the input in this case?\n",
    " - should I change the max timesteps? as both targets are on the same environment, possible options: keep same, have different stepcounts for each, have one higher for both together - leave the same\n",
    " - what if uvf go to actual goal - doesnt matter\n",
