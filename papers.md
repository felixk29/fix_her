### List of papers
Day ones:  

 - [HER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.01495.pdf) the GOAT obviously 
 
 - [Go Explore](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.10995.pdf) breakthrough algorithm for exploration of rl, 1. part is finding path via teleport exploration 2. is robusting path, considered cheating as it just loads states and sets to deterministic,

 - [Max Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05727.pdf) introduces the problem of generalization across topologys also has experiments I will yoink probably

 - [Generalized Hindsight for Reinforcement Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2020/file/57e5cb96e22546001f1d6520ff11d9ba-Paper.pdf) generalized version of HER with adaption to learn generalized goals better

 - [A Survey of Zero-shot Generalisation in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1613/jair.1.14174) 2023, survey, very insightfull, cmdp etc.. definitions fresh for the yoinking, also tables interesting (table 1.-3.)
  


side pieces:  

 - [Learning Montezumaâ€™s Revenge from a Single Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03381.pdf) utilized by go explore to robust learned path, as go explore just figures out 1 path so absolutely overfitted

 - [Zero-Shot Generalization MC](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/oh17a/oh17a.pdf) agent learns "do x regarding a", "do y regarding b" has to zero shot generalize to "do x regarding b" 

 - [From one game to many](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=sSt9fROSZRO) trains on x variants of an atari game, tries to generalize/finetune for x+y games, more of an investigative paper than new methodology, uses IMPALA (actor-critic)
 
 - [Multi-task Batch Reinforcement Learning with Metric Learning](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/4496bf24afe7fab6f046bf4923da8de6-Abstract.html) learn unseen tasks from the same distribution as the seen task, but no task identifier, task identifier has to be implicitly learned, 

 - [A Survey of Multi-Task Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/9/9/1363) a survey

 - [Deep Decentralized Multi-task Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/omidshafiei17a.html) just put it here becuase its "Suffering the paper", will prob not be included
